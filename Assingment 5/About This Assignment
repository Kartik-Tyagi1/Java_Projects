This assignment was to practice using JavaFX. Using scene builder and eclipse I created a paint app. 

It allows the user to draw objects in 4 colors (red, green, black, blue) in 3 sizes (small, medium, large) using a 
  circular or square brush
  
There is also a serialize button which allows the user to save the drawing made by the circular brush, using XML serialization
